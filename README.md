# Plotly_Vizualization
This is a repo for visualizing some lists with Plotly

Thanks to [Listenchampion](https://www.listenchampion.de) that they provided a small list to me for Visualization Purposes. This Repo will use a list of selected *automotive suppliers throughout Germany*. 

## Installation 

First of all you have to install all the necessary packages: 

``` python
pip3 install pandas, plotly, chart_studio, re
```
After you run all of them, it should be possible to run each cell in the jupyter notebook.
